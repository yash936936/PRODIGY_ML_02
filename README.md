# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to segment retail customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the K-means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation helps businesses target marketing strategies, personalize offers, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to identify natural groupings among retail customers using features such as annual income and spending score. This segmentation provides actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Approach

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the dataset and examine its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and scale features.
3. **Feature Selection:** Use relevant features (e.g., annual income, spending score) for clustering.
4. **Optimal K Selection:** Use the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to determine the best number of clusters.
5. **Model Training:** Apply K-means clustering.
6. **Visualization:** Visualize the resulting clusters for interpretation.

## How to Select Optimal K

### 1. Elbow Method

- **Plot the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) for a range of K values (e.g., 1 to 10).**
- **Look for the "elbow" point** where the rate of decrease sharply slows. This is the optimal K.

### 2. Silhouette Method

- **Calculate the average silhouette score for each K.**
- **Choose the K with the highest silhouette score**, indicating well-separated clusters.

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository** or download the code files.
2. **Add your dataset** (e.g., `Mall_Customers.csv`) to the project directory.
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
4. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python customer_segmentation.py
    ```

## Files

- `customer_segmentation.py` – Main script for clustering and visualization.
- `Mall_Customers.csv` – Example dataset (not included; provide your own).

## Results

- **Cluster assignments** for each customer.
- **Elbow plot** to help choose K.
- **Scatter plot** visualizing customer segments.

## Conclusion

K-means clustering effectively segments customers based on their behavior. The Elbow and Silhouette methods are practical tools for selecting the optimal number of clusters. This segmentation can drive targeted marketing and improved customer engagement.

## Next Steps

- Add more features (e.g., age, gender, purchase frequency).
- Profile each cluster for business insights.
- Experiment with other clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering).
- Integrate clustering results into business analytics dashboards.
